## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

This site features select baseball-related materials from the [Joyce Sports Research Collection](https://rarebooks.library.nd.edu/collections/sports/index.html) at the University of Notre Dame's Hesburgh Libraries, Rare Books & Special Collections. Materials were selected by curator Dr. Greg Bond, and metadata was generated by students in Dr. Katherine Walden's F24 "Baseball & America" course.
